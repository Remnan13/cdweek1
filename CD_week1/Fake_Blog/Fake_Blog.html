			<h2>Asha's Background</h2>
			<br><br>
			<p>Born in a province of the Korean peninsula along the southern coast, Asha's first three months were spent on a dog meat farm. She was the smallest of four puppies - the runt of her litter - and was marked for euthanization after her body didn't grow on par with her brothers and sister. Disease, however, saved her life. A distemper outbreak forced the farm to prioritize culling any dogs over one-year-old to curb the sickness. Asha, along with hundreds of other young dogs, was transported to a veterinary clinic. Any dogs which were not on those outbound flatbed trucks never made it out alive. Learning Asha's circumstances, the Korean nurses created a profile for Asha on a rescue website.

			<h3>Rescue</h3>
			<p>Filling out an adoption form, I was excited to bring Asha from Jeonju to my home in Seoul. But after meeting the vet, I was left with plenty of problems, yet no puppy.

				<p>Objectively, things weren't looking great. I returned to Seoul without Asha, with a $300 hole in my pocket, and the smug grin of an older gentleman who knew full well that I had no recourse for saving Asha. Back in Seoul, I was able to link up with a Korean friend who had legal experience. We discussed the situation and agreed that time was not our friend. Two days later, we boarded the KTX train for another lumbering two-hour-long sojourn south.
				<br>
				Upon arrival at the vet, we were ready for a brawl. My friend, Hyuk, was rocking his power suit in direct contrast to my jeans and tshirt. But there was no vet. The nurses explained that he left for lunch, but knew about the whole scam.
				<br>
				"Count it as store credit," one of the two ladies urged. Grabbing a leash and collar, Hyuk, the nurse, and I ventured into the dimly lit stench below.

				<br><br>
				The first thing I noticed and the last thing I will forget is the hollow pit which opened up in my stomach. In the darkness, I made out rows upon rows of dog cages made of chicken-wire and rusted hinges. Dozens of columns stacked taller than Hyuk, who was well over 6 feet tall. There was wimpering, crying, barking, all the din of a puppy kennel smothered by the smell of urine and the miasma of fear.
				<br><br>
				"We can take more."
				<br>
				"No. We have to go - now."
				<br>

				<br><br>
				"We can do it," my eyes sting from the stench and wincing from the barking and whining. "Let's bring at least 3 plus Asha, go get a bigger kennel."
				<br>
				 I remember the nurse pulling her out of her cage - not unkindly - and still seeing Asha's tail trembling between her legs. It was only after we got her outside that Asha stoped crying. But I still did.
				</p>
				<br><br>
				<p>It has been almost five years since I went to Jeonju to adopt Asha. Since then, she has grown into a curious, clever, and devilishly cute member of my family. She's vocal, challenging the biggest men in our house to bouts of tug-of-war, but is protective of the youngest children like a four-legged mother. She has been joined by a little brother, Haku, who is as dull as he is adorable.
