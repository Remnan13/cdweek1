			<p>Because sometimes a dumbass needs to be reminded they don't know shit, Morty.</p>

		<div class="sectRow" id="addClass">
			<h2>.addClass()</h2>
			<br>
			<img class="gif" src="flipoff.gif" alt="flipoff">

			<button id="button_addClass">AddClass</button>
			<p>A-a-alright. Let's get into this before I pass out. When--belch--you input the .addClass() effect, you're calling for the selector to experience an event of adding the specified class(es) to each element in the set of matched elements. Not very cool, Morty. W-w-what did those elements do to you? Fuck tungsten, but carbon didn't ever hurt anyone. Except for its role in the manufacturing of, of, of basically all weapons. Fuck carbon. G-g-g-go ahead and click the button, Morty. That will change the color of this paragraph, really blows your little mind - doesn't it?! Summer, go get grandpa a beer like a good grandparent-grandchild nesting.</p>

		<div class="sectRow" id="slideToggle">
			<h2>.slideToggle()</h2>
			<button>SlideToggle</button>
			<p>Holy F*&%, MORTY! Click the button--j-just click it! It's a chimera produced by a super-advanced interdimensional rift between East Asian gatcha marketing and how covetous children. T-they just had to recognize the fact that parents are more likely to use their wallets to buy kids' distracted happiness rather than have them learn viable life-lessons. That's why grandpa studies science and not--belch--economics, Morty. I'm not a sheep. I don't herd. I don't need 'em all. I create, destroy, and never trade. Now click the button and see how the slideToggle effect reveals your pathetic prepubescent years rendered as a simple image.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="sectRow" id="toggle">
			<h2>.toggle()</h2>
			<button>Cheer Up, Morty</button>
			<p>Eek barga durkle, Morty. You can stop crying already. Here, toggle this button to feel better, tiger.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="sectRow" id="click">
			<h2>.click()</h2>
			<button>Click to click!</button>
			<p>Pretty self-explanatory, Morty. E-e-even you can wrap your head around this one. Bind an event handler to the “click” JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. Oh, I'm sorry! Did a little jargon fuck up your understanding? Wow, you really are a Morty.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="sectRow" id="hide">
			<h2>.hide()</h2>
			<button>You can run... bitch!</button>
			<p>W-w...we gotta hide the matched elements, Morty! Y-y-y-you can't possibly under --belch--stand the complexities involved in hiding from an interdimensional dreamwalker you pubescent fuck! Oh shit! D-don't click the-- RUN MORTY!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="sectRow" id="sliding">
			<h2>.slide[Down or Up]()</h2>
			<button>Sliding Button</button>
			<p>A-a-alright. This is a little counterintuitive, Morty. You'll be hiding shit if you code slideUP, or displaying matched elements by calling slideDown. Kinda like the way y-y-your dad manages to slideDown into the lives of people who otherwise would be much better off. N-n-now don't --belch-- think of that as an insult. Just stating a fact. It's not popular, but when the fuck did facts matter to teenagers anyways, Morty? God dammit I need to /slideUp your dad, Morty. Yeah, I said it. Sometimes threats in code are more art than science.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="sectRow" id="fade">
			<h2>.fade[In or Out]</h2>
			<button>Fade Button</button>
			<p>C-c-click the --belch--utton and take a look. Fade works like grandpa's alcohol, Morty. It makes things clear or opaque. Drinks go In, and the world gets opacque. O-o-or elements get opaque. FadeIn makes it transparent, Morty. IT. JUST. DOES.</p>
